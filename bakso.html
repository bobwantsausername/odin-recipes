    <h4>Delicios bakso</h4>
    <p>Bakso is Indonesian meatball, and is an extremely popular Indonesian food. It’s everywhere; you’re just as likely to find it being sold by street vendors (called kaki lima), mom and pop eateries and swanky restaurants. I used to love ordering these fresh from the street vendors. And having them with all manner of chilli condiments. But I didn’t have to be in Indonesia to enjoy its delights.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Minced beef</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Ice water</li>
        <li>Fried shallots</li>
        <li>Beef stock powder</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Beef stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to cook:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beef, garlic, fried shallot, baking powder, beef stock powder and egg into a large mixing bowl. Mix well to combine with your hands. Next, add half the cornstarch and mix through, then half the ice water and mix again. Repeat with the remaining half of the cornstarch and ice water</li>
        <li>Using gloves, make the meatballs by squeezing the mixture a few times between your thumb and forefinger until smooth. The meatball should be the size of a ping pong ball. Scoop off with a teaspoon and place into a large pot of hot water. Note: Watch video for the technique. Alternatively, take tablespoon of mixture, and roll between your palms into a meatball shape.</li>
        <li>Pop the pot onto the stove over high heat and bring to the boil. Make sure the meatballs don’t stick to the bottom. They’ll float once they’re cooked through (around 15-20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Pop your garlic, ginger, chopped celery, crushed lemongrass, sugar, spring onion and beef stock into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue to cook for 5 minutes before switching off the heat. Garnish with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, place 4-5 meatballs and any accompaniments you’d like (bak choy, noodles, tofu etc) before pouring 2-3 ladles over the top. Add your favourite sauces such as sambal and kecap manis, and enjoy!s</li>
